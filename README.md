# Calculator_Kata
Very easy and diverse kata to introduce people to test first implementation. 

## The goal

Read the requirements description of the simple online calculator. What are the possible use cases you see?
What are the begin situations and what are the expected results?

Then, create tests for each use case before you actually do the implementation. 

## Requirements

The first kata is extremely simple. We need a very basic online calculator. It needs to be able to do a summation of a 
range of numbers, it needs to be able to do a multiplication of a range of numbers, it needs to be able to subtract a 
range of numbers and it needs to be able to do a simple division of 2 numbers.

Which features or use cases do you see in this problem definition? Describe the start situation (as in what the process 
needs to start) and the desired results.
